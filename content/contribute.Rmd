Thank you for thinking about contributing! Any community driven projects are generally done in a volunteer basis so whether it works well or not is all up to people who generously volunteer their time and effort. 

For a long-term sustainability, the expectation is that community will largely self-regulate. There is a general expectation that any ideas, suggestions or feedbacks will be discussed in the `#feedback` channel in slack. 

For the contribution to this website, you may like to raise issues in the github repositary or make pull requests. This does require you to be familiar with github so if you feel that is a hurdle for us to hear your idea, please do leave requested changes and suggestions on the `#feedback` channel in slack!

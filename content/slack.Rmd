Slack is a messaging platform. This is best explained by some demonstrations.

## Getting Started

Everyone who joins will be greeted by a `slackbot` that will explain the general features of how to use slack and also a `greetbot`. The current message in `greetbot` will display

This greeting may be subject to change after community input. 

## Channel

There are various channels that people can join. Everyone is in the `general`, `random` and `jobandopportunities` channel. There are two types of channels: public and private. Everyone can browse, join and create public channels. Private channels can be created by anyone and can only be joined by invite. The current list of channels available are:

## Posting 

Posting a message is easy. You may want to think about what is the most appropriate channel to post. E.g. if you have a regional meeting then you may like to post to the corresponding region channel. 

You can also post codes easily in slack:

Or make it a bit fun with emoticons:

It is also easy to organise conversations by a thread within channels:
